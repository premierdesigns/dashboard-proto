      #### FUNCTIONALITY

      - Each "white box" on the dashboard page represents a card with a widget showing various bits of data
      - Some of these boxes will be customizable by the jeweler, some will not.
      - Action bar across the top will be for search, help/support, quick-add (order, show, contact, etc), and notifications
      - Cards can be customized on where they sit and how big they are

      #### QUESTIONS

      #### IDEAS

      Cards:
      - Sales
        - Year-to-date
        - vs. previous year
        - past six months (or some other amount)
      - Upcoming Shows
      - Current promotions
      - New jewelers in my downline

      FUTURE
      - Add community, 'social media' type functionality to the entire dashboard

      #### DATA

      The data that shows up and needs to be connected here will vary and change based on what cards/widgets are showing on the dashboard.
