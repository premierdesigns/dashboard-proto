    #### FUNCTIONALITY

    - This page will be similar to the [Jeweler Training](https://jeweler.premierdesigns.com/en/training) page that the jewelers have now.

    #### QUESTIONS

    #### IDEAS

    - We should have training courses that train jewelers progressively on various aspects and not just a-la carte videos.
    - Points & 'medals' can be awarded based on videos watched and courses completed.
    - Higher up jewelers can see what videos and courses their downline has done.

    #### DATA


    * We should over-haul this to be more focused instead of just random videos for the user to watch
    ** Some sort of training paths that the jewelers can take that they are guided through
